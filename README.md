Building a graph of the Internet, one button at a time. Website available [here](https://eightyeightthirty.one).

This is split into two programs: a CLI scraper tool that talks to WebDrivers to fetch websites, and a React app to render a graph. Websites are scanned for images, and images that match the 88x31 resolution and link to another site are logged. It respects robots.txt and is aware of redirects.
